				<h1>Hello, my name is Jeremy.</h1>
				<h2>Welcome to my website.</h2>
				<p>I am a student at Edmonds College pursuing a computer degree that can lead to a good job in the tech industry. In 2020, after working for decades in manual labor roles, I decided to make a change in my life and go to college. This has been an amazing experience, and I have learned a lot.</p>
				<p>I decided to get a degree that would open doors to a career in the tech industry because my first "Intro to Programming" class was so much fun, and the work of programming felt so fulfilling. I love solving puzzles, building programs from the ground up, and troubleshooting problems until they are fixed. The feeling of writing a program that looks and works great is my inspiration.</p>
				<p>While I'm just a beginner in the world of web and software development, I am having a great time on the journey towards marketable competency, and I look forward to reaching the level of professional software developer. I have a lot to learn, and having the ability and opportunity to do so is a real blessing.</p>
